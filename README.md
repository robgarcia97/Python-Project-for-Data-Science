# Python-Project-for-Data-Science
# As a Data Scientist/Data Analyst, I embarked on a real-world project to showcase my proficiency in Python, the preferred language for Data Science and Data Analysis. This project serves as a testament to my mastery of Python fundamentals, adept use of Python data structures, and the art of working with data in Python.

# Project Objectives:

# Data Acquisition:

# Utilized Python to gather relevant data for analysis, employing tools such as Beautiful Soup for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation.
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

# Applied Python data structures and Pandas to clean and preprocess the acquired data, ensuring its quality and suitability for analysis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

# Leveraged Python's data analysis capabilities to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, gaining insights into patterns, trends, and potential correlations within the dataset.
# Dashboard Creation:

# Constructed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Plotly within a Jupyter notebook, enhancing data visualization and presenting key findings.
Key Technologies and Libraries Used:

# Python: Employed Python as the primary programming language for the entire project.
